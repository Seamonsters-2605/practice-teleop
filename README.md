# practice-teleop

**Challenge:** Make a robot to navigate a virtual obstacle course.

Download this code with Git Bash by typing:

```
cd ~/Documents
git clone https://github.com/Seamonsters-2605/practice-teleop
```

There will be a folder in your Documents folder called `practice-teleop`. Open a Command Prompt window here (hold shift and right click in an empty space in the window, and choose "Open Command Prompt window here"). If you run the command `python robot.py sim`, you will see the robot simulator with an obstacle course. You can click the "Teleoperated" button to run the robot (nothing will happen right now because there is no robot code).

You will need to edit `robot.py` to make the robot navigate the course without touching any green walls, and end in the yellow box. You can use the [Teleop Code Examples](https://seamonsters-2605.github.io/docs/teleop-examples/) page as a reference.
